# Simulate-and-Recover: EZ Diffusion Model

This project implements a simulate-and-recover exercise for the EZ Diffusion Model to evaluate its ability to estimate parameters from data it generates. The model is parameterized by boundary separation (α), drift rate (ν), and nondecision time (τ), which are randomly sampled within realistic cognitive modeling ranges. Using these values, the model computes predicted summary statistics, including accuracy rate (R_pred), mean reaction time (M_pred), and reaction time variance (V_pred). Observed data is simulated by introducing variability through binomial, normal, and gamma distributions, mimicking real cognitive decision-making data. The inverse equations are then applied to recover parameter estimates (ν_est, α_est, τ_est), which are compared to the original parameters. The results of this process reveal that parameter recovery improves as the sample size increases. For small sample sizes (N=10), estimation bias is larger, and squared error is higher, leading to less accurate recovery of the true parameters. As N increases (N=40, N=4000), bias decreases, and squared error is reduced, confirming that the EZ Diffusion Model performs well in parameter recovery given sufficient data. This aligns with the expectation that larger datasets mitigate variability and allow the inverse equations to approximate the true generating values more accurately. The experiment demonstrates that the EZ Diffusion Model is self-consistent, meaning it can reliably recover its own parameters under ideal conditions. However, some variance in estimation is still observed, particularly for smaller datasets, indicating that additional noise or model extensions may be necessary in practical applications. The results confirm the model’s usefulness in cognitive modeling and highlight its limitations when data is sparse. This study validates the EZ Diffusion Model’s applicability for estimating decision-making processes while emphasizing the importance of sufficient trial counts in achieving accurate parameter recovery.
